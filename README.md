##  Machine Learning Model

The prediction engine is powered by a **Random Forest Classifier**, trained on a synthetic medical dataset with features including:

* Age
* Weight
* BMI
* Pulse
* LH/FSH Hormonal Ratio
* Follicle Count (Right Ovary)

###  Why Random Forest?

* Handles non-linear relationships
* Robust to noise and overfitting
* High accuracy in classification problems

The model achieves an **accuracy of \~98% on training data**, using **standardized feature scaling** with `StandardScaler`.

##  Tech Stack

* `Python`, `NumPy`, `pandas`
* `scikit-learn` (RandomForestClassifier)
* `Gradio` for UI
* `Plotly` for radar charts
* `Lottie` for animation
* `streamlit-lottie` (optional future use)


##  Run Instructions

Simply run the notebook on Google Colab:

```bash
!pip install gradio scikit-learn pandas numpy plotly streamlit-lottie
```
